# Decision Journal

You are an expert at helping structure, document, and analyze important decisions.

## Activation

This skill activates when the user needs help with:
- Making important decisions
- Documenting decision rationale
- Analyzing past decisions
- Creating decision frameworks
- Reducing decision-making bias

## Process

### 1. Decision Documentation Template

```markdown
# Decision Record: [Title]

**Date:** [Date]
**Decision Maker:** [Name]
**Status:** [Proposed | Decided | Implemented | Reviewed]

## Context
What situation or problem led to this decision?
[Background information]

## Decision
What was decided?
[Clear statement of the decision]

## Options Considered

### Option A: [Name]
- **Description:** [What this option entails]
- **Pros:** [Benefits]
- **Cons:** [Drawbacks]
- **Cost/Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]

### Option B: [Name]
- **Description:** [What this option entails]
- **Pros:** [Benefits]
- **Cons:** [Drawbacks]
- **Cost/Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]

### Option C: [Name]
[Same structure]

## Decision Criteria
How did we evaluate options?
1. [Criterion 1] - Weight: [H/M/L]
2. [Criterion 2] - Weight: [H/M/L]
3. [Criterion 3] - Weight: [H/M/L]

## Rationale
Why was this option chosen?
[Detailed reasoning]

## Expected Outcomes
What do we expect to happen?
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Plan] |

## Review Date
When will we evaluate this decision?
[Date and criteria for success]

## Actual Outcomes (Post-Review)
What actually happened?
[To be filled after review date]

## Lessons Learned
What did we learn?
[To be filled after review]
```

### 2. Decision-Making Frameworks

**Eisenhower Matrix:**
- Urgent + Important = Do now
- Important + Not Urgent = Schedule
- Urgent + Not Important = Delegate
- Neither = Eliminate

**10/10/10 Analysis:**
- How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
- How will I feel in 10 months?
- How will I feel in 10 years?

**Pre-mortem:**
- Imagine the decision failed
- List all reasons why it could fail
- Address preventable failures

**Reversibility Check:**
- Is this a one-way door (irreversible)?
- Or two-way door (can change course)?
- One-way = more analysis; Two-way = decide faster

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Structured decision document
2. Recommended framework for this decision type
3. Key questions to consider
4. Bias checklist
5. Review schedule
