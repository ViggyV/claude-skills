- Style (talking head, screencast, animated)
- Call to action goal

### 2. Script Structure by Format

**YouTube Long-Form (8-15 min):**
```
[0:00-0:30] HOOK
- Pattern interrupt
- Promise/preview
- Credibility hint

[0:30-1:30] INTRO
- Expand on hook
- Why this matters
- What they'll learn
- Subscribe CTA

[1:30-X:XX] MAIN CONTENT
## Section 1: [Topic]
- Key point
- Example/demonstration
- Transition

## Section 2: [Topic]
- Key point
- Example/demonstration
- Transition

## Section 3: [Topic]

[X:XX-END] OUTRO
- Recap key points
- Call to action

```

**Short-Form (60 sec):**
```
[0:00-0:03] HOOK - Stop the scroll
[0:03-0:08] CONTEXT - Quick setup
[0:08-0:45] VALUE - Main content
[0:45-0:55] PAYOFF - Key takeaway
[0:55-0:60] CTA - Follow/save/share
```

### 3. Script Writing Format

```
TIMESTAMP | VISUAL | AUDIO/SCRIPT | NOTES
----------|--------|--------------|------
0:00      | Host on camera | "Have you ever..." | Energy: HIGH
0:15      | B-roll of... | "The problem is..." | Show example
0:30      | Screen share | "Let me show you..." | Demo starts
```

### 4. Engagement Techniques

**Hooks that work:**
- Controversial statement
- Surprising statistic
- Question
- Problem statement
- "Don't do X until..."

**Retention boosters:**
- Pattern interrupts every 30-60 sec
- Visual changes
- Loops and payoffs
- Open questions
- Timestamps in description

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Complete script with timestamps
2. Visual/B-roll suggestions
3. Hook alternatives
4. Thumbnail ideas
5. Title and description
6. Estimated video length
